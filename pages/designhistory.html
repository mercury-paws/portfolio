            <h2>History of Design</h2>
            <p class="aim-text">
              The history of design spans centuries and reflects humanity's
              evolving relationship with function, form, and beauty. From
              ancient symbolic patterns to modern minimalism, design has been a
              visual language used to communicate values, status, and
              innovation. Each era brought distinctive styles influenced by
              culture, technology, and social change.
            </p>
            <p class="aim-text">
              As societies grew more complex, design developed from craft-based
              ornamentation into a powerful discipline shaping everything from
              everyday objects to architectural landscapes.

            <h2>Repetitive Design Patterns</h2>
            <p class="aim-text">
              Repetition in design creates harmony, rhythm, and continuity.
              Across civilizations, recurring motifs have symbolized beliefs,
              structured compositions, and enhanced aesthetics. These patterns,
              often deeply rooted in cultural identity, transcend time through
              their balanced, symmetrical arrangements.
            </p>
            <p class="aim-text">
              Let's explore six influential styles that utilize repetition
              uniquely:

          <!-- Victorian -->
          <div class="design-section">

            <div>
              <h3>Victorian</h3>
              <p>
                Victorian design emerged during Queen Victoria's reign
                (1837-1901) and emphasized opulence and intricate detail.
                Repetitive floral patterns, damasks, and ornate scrollwork
                reflected wealth and sophistication. The era favored symmetry
                and layering of patterns in wallpapers, textiles, and
                furnishings.
              </p>

            <div>
              <h3>Art Deco</h3>
              <p>
                Art Deco, popular in the 1920s-30s, embraced geometric
                repetition, bold lines, and metallics. It was a style of luxury
                and modernity, often featuring sunbursts, chevrons, and stepped
                forms. Repetition added elegance and futuristic flair to
                buildings, interiors, and fashion.
              </p>
            </div>

          <!-- Bauhaus -->
          <div class="design-section">

            <div>
              <h3>Bauhaus</h3>
              <p>
                The Bauhaus school, founded in 1919 in Germany, championed
                simplicity and function. Repetition of basic geometric
                shapes—circles, triangles, squares—defined its minimalist
                aesthetic. This approach made design accessible, unifying art,
                craft, and industry.

            <div>
              <h3>Aztec</h3>
              <p>
                Aztec design is recognized by its bold, symmetrical motifs and
                symbolic imagery. Repeated zigzags, step-fret shapes, and
                stylized animals conveyed spiritual meaning and cosmic order.
                These patterns adorned textiles, temples, and ceramics,
                expressing power and belief.

            <div>
              <h3>Islamic</h3>
              <p>
                Islamic design is known for its infinite geometric patterns,
                tessellations, and arabesques. Avoiding figurative imagery, it
                celebrates divine unity through complex repetition. These motifs
                are found in mosques, tiles, and manuscripts, often using
                interlaced stars and polygons.

            <div>
              <h3>Japanese</h3>
              <p>
                Traditional Japanese patterns, or *wagara*, incorporate natural
                themes like waves, clouds, and chrysanthemums. These motifs,
                repeated in elegant rhythms, reflect harmony and simplicity.
                Repetition in Japanese design emphasizes balance, seasonality,
                and a connection to nature.

              <ul>
                <li>Title: Sistine Madonna</li>
                <li>Artist: Raphael (Raffaello Sanzio da Urbino)</li>
                <li>Date: c. 1512</li>
                <li></li>
                <li>Medium: Oil on canvas</li>
                <li>Dimensions: Approximately 265 cm x 196 cm</li>
                <li>
                  Current location: Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister, Dresden,
                  Germany

              </ul>
              <p>
                What drew me to this work was precisely the emotional ambiguity.
                The Madonna is not idealized to the point of detachment; rather,
                she is human. Her expression reminds me of moments of quiet
                dread before a major life change. It connects with the idea of
                knowing something painful is coming and still choosing to go
                forward. This painting made me think of religious icons, but
                also of modern depictions of motherhood that show vulnerability
                rather than perfection. The cherubs at the bottom add a touch of
                innocence and contrast, but I can't help but feel they emphasize
                the solemnity above them. I believe Sistine Madonna holds a
                place in the museum not just for its artistic mastery but for
                its emotional intelligence. It says something universal through
                religious imagery.

              <h3>The Chocolate Girl</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Title: The Chocolate Girl (German: Das Schokoladenmädchen)
                </li>
                <li>Artist: Jean-Étienne Liotard</li>
                <li>Date: c. 1743-1745</li>
                <li>Medium: Pastel on parchment, mounted on canvas</li>
                <li>Dimensions: Approx. 82 cm x 52 cm</li>
                <li>
                  Current location: Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister, Dresden,

              </ul>
              <p>
                What drew me to this painting is its ability to make the
                ordinary seem extraordinary. She is not a saint, a mythological
                figure, or royalty—she's a servant, possibly delivering a
                breakfast tray. Yet, she's painted with dignity and care, as if
                Liotard deeply admired her presence. It reminded me of the
                modern appreciation for everyday beauty, like candid street
                photography or film stills that capture silent moments. There's
                no drama here, no high symbolism—just an honest portrayal of
                grace in routine. I think this painting is in a museum because
                it shows technical brilliance in pastel (a challenging medium)
                and also shifts the focus of art from nobility and myth to the
                realism and respect of human labor and character. It invites us
                to notice and value what is usually overlooked.

                What drew me in was the feeling of the sky moving—like something
                eternal and unknowable pressing down over something small and
                still. The painting reminds me of nights when thoughts race and
                sleep won't come, when the stars feel close enough to touch but
                distant all the same. The cypress tree reminded me of a flame or
                a reaching hand—it feels symbolic, maybe of longing or
                connection. I also saw a kind of hope in the glowing orbs of
                stars, a belief that beauty and wonder persist even in mental
                turmoil. This painting feels deeply personal, as if we're seeing
                the world not just through Van Gogh's eyes, but through his
                emotions. It's in the museum not only because of its fame and
                beauty, but because it captures the rawness of human
                feeling—grief, awe, isolation, and imagination—all in one
                moment.

                  often exhibited in Chicano art retrospectives and museum shows

                What drew me to Poor Party was how it honors a scene that might
                otherwise go unnoticed or dismissed. It reminds me of
                neighborhoods I've passed by or lived in—where people gather in
                parking lots, yards, or street corners late at night to share
                music, drinks, and life, not because they have luxury, but
                because they have each other. There's something so honest and
                unfiltered in how the people are shown. They're not idealized or
                judged; they just are. The work makes me think about how art
                often leaves out working-class stories unless they're
                romanticized or politicized—Valadez does neither. He just
                presents people as they are, beautifully. I believe Poor Party
                is exhibited in galleries and museums because it reframes what
                is considered 'museum-worthy.' It brings Chicano culture,
                everyday struggle, and community pride into the center of the
                art world. It's not just technically brilliant—it's socially
                vital.

                I was drawn to this work because it confused me. At first I
                couldn't tell if it was a sculpture or a real building. Then I
                realized that's exactly the point—it blurs the boundary between
                function and form, art and infrastructure. It reminded me of the
                Centre Pompidou itself, which famously wears its mechanical
                systems on the outside. But Rossi's approach felt more chaotic,
                even mythic—like a city built after a revolution, or in a
                post-human future. This made me think about the cities we live
                in now—how sterile or lifeless they can be. Rossi's L'uvre
                proposes something more daring: cities that breathe, stretch,
                mutate. It's not just a design—it's an argument. I believe it's
                shown in institutions like the Centre Pompidou because it
                challenges our expectations of architecture. It's not
                comfortable. It's a manifesto in physical form.

                This piece caught my attention because it doesn't 'look' like
                art or science at first glance. It's both, and neither. I was
                struck by how quickly it made me feel something. It didn't tell
                me anything—it showed me. It reminded me of Alvin Lustig's
                modernist graphic designs—how he could suggest complex emotions
                with just shape and tone. Like Lustig, Hawkins embraces
                abstraction to deliver clarity. There's also something of Mark
                Rothko in the way the bands of color speak without
                words—meditative but also unsettling. I believe this work
                belongs in museums, galleries, classrooms, and public spaces
                because it redefines how data can be felt, not just understood.
                It's a visual siren: elegant, immediate, and unforgettable.
